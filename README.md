# Animations
##### Final project @ [Yrgo](https://github.com/yrgo)

This project is a collaboration between three students from the Digital Design and Web Developer classes at Yrgo. We wanted to explore how a website can be brought to life by adding decorative animations to it. The animations are built with CSS, JavaScript and SVG.
